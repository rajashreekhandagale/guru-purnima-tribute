    <h1>Dear Swapna Ma'am,</h1>
    <p>
      You were not just my Physics teacher ‚Äî you were a guide, a friend, and the light in my academic journey. ‚öõÔ∏è<br>
      Your voice still echoes in my heart when I think about ‚ÄúEnergy‚Äù, ‚ÄúGravity‚Äù, and ‚ÄúWaves‚Äù... but also about **patience**, **strength**, and **compassion**.
    </p>
    <p>
      In your classroom, science came alive. You taught me how to calculate forces, but also how to face them in life.  
      Your teachings made me believe in myself, even when the equations seemed impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for explaining not only Physics, but life‚Äôs uncertainties too ‚Äî with love and clarity.  
      Every lesson from you was a formula of wisdom and warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will forever carry your teachings in my heart.<br>
      This website is a small tribute to your big impact on my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all my love and gratitude, <br>
      <strong>Rajashree üíñ</strong>
